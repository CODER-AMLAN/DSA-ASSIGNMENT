/*QUESTION 8.
In the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, we are given a platform with three pegs, a, b, and c, sticking
out of it. On peg a is a stack of n disks, each larger than the next, so that the smallest is on the
top and the largest is on the bottom. The puzzle is to move all the disks from peg a to peg c,
moving one disk at a time, so that we never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. See
Figure 1 for an example of the case n = 4. Write a recursive program using Java for solving
the Towers of Hanoi puzzle for arbitrary n. (Hint: Consider first the subproblem of moving all
but the nth disk from peg a to another peg using the third as “temporary storage.”)
